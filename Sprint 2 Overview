TripleTen Sprint 2 Project - EDA
This is the 2nd project I worked on in the TripleTen Data Science program. This project was the most independent project I've worked on so far, and I loved it.

Instacart Orders
The goal of the project was to clean the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers, including plot to help communicate the results.

The Data
The data was spread across five files:

instacart_orders.csv: each row corresponds to one order on the Instacart app
'order_id': ID number that uniquely identifies each order
'user_id': ID number that uniquely identifies each customer account
'order_number': the number of times this customer has placed an order
'order_dow': day of the week that the order placed (which day is 0 is uncertain)
'order_hour_of_day': hour of the day that the order was placed
'days_since_prior_order': number of days since this customer placed their previous order
products.csv: each row corresponds to a unique product that customers can buy
'product_id': ID number that uniquely identifies each product
'product_name': name of the product
'aisle_id': ID number that uniquely identifies each grocery aisle category
'department_id': ID number that uniquely identifies each grocery department category
order_products.csv: each row corresponds to one item placed in an order
'order_id': ID number that uniquely identifies each order
'product_id': ID number that uniquely identifies each product
'add_to_cart_order': the sequential order in which each item was placed in the cart
'reordered': 0 if the customer has never ordered this product before, 1 if they have
aisles.csv
'aisle_id': ID number that uniquely identifies each grocery aisle category
'aisle': name of the aisle
departments.csv
'department_id': ID number that uniquely identifies each grocery department category
'department': name of the department
The data is provided by TripleTen, who took it from Kaggle and modified it.

The Process
I first explored the dataset to find and fix missing and duplicate values, and I merged DataFrames from different sources. Finally, I analyzed the data using visualizations and pivot tables.

Results
Taking the time to explain my results at each step was a key element in this process, and this was my first attempt at doing it. I wrote an introduction and conclusion that outlined what I did, and made suggestions for Instacart to consider in the future.

Please have a look at the Jupyter Notebook included for a full description of results.
