# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | TV show ratings| The project task was to analyze user data and investigate the assumption that highly rated TV shows from the Golden Age of television also garner the most votes on IMDb. |
| 2 | Instacart | The project task was to prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers |
| 3 | [Megaline Telecom Operator](https://github.com/oliver-worth/Stats_Telco) | The project was to prepare statistical analysis for two different prepaid plans for a telecom operator called Megaline and to determine which plan brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. |
| 4 | [Video Game Company](https://github.com/oliver-worth/GameStore-Ice-) | I analyzed data for the Ice online video game store to identify patterns in user and expert reviews, genres, platforms, and sales history since 2016, aiming to predict successful games for future advertising campaigns while considering ESRB ratings.
| 5 | [Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/oliver-worth/Machine-Learning-project.git) | This project involved using machine learning techniques to process and analyze data, employing a Random Forest model to predict outcomes and then evaluate model performance using an accuracy score and a confusion matrix.
| 6 | [Beta Bank Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/oliver-worth/Beta-Bank) | This project involved using Exploratory Data Analysis to determine which categories of data were affecting churn rate on customers at Beta Bank. I then created an effective machine learning model that predicts which customers are most likely to churn based on the given data.
| 7 | [OilyGiant Mining Company](https://github.com/oliver-worth/Profitable-Regions-for-Oil.git) | This project developed a machine learning model to predict oil reserve volumes by well, based on regional features, and employed bootstrapping techniques to assess potential profits and risks associated with drilling in each region
| 8 | [Zyfra Gold Mining Data Science](https://github.com/oliver-worth/Gold-Concentration-Machine-Learning.git) | This project developed an efficient machine learning model that predicts the amount of gold recovered from ore, employing exploratory data analysis to explain many different features of the different processes and their stages for extracting metals as well as using cross validation ML techniques to determine which model was best to use in the end.
